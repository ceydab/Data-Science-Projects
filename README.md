# Data-Science-Projects
Welcome to the Data Science Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of Python scripts representing various data science projects. While the primary focus is on data analysis and machine learning, some projects also incorporate SQL for data manipulation and querying.

## **Projects Included**

Each project is contained within its own .py or .ipynb file, along with outputs and explanations of the code.

## **Note**
This repository reflects my learning journey and includes practical applications of Data Science techniques. It will continue to be updated with new projects and improvements over time.
