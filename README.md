# Data-Science-Projects
Welcome to the Data Science Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of Python scripts representing various data science projects. While the primary focus is on data analysis and machine learning, some projects also incorporate SQL for data manipulation and querying.


## **Projects Included**
1. **Book Cover**: Uses web scraping to extract bookcover information into MongoDB, and analyzes it.
2. **Random Walks**: Creates random walks and analyzes them.
3. **Baby Names**: Imports baby names over the years and analyzes it.
4. **Earthquake**: Imports earthquake and geological information and plots earthquake locations on a map.
5. **Election**: Performs several plots on 2012 election data
6. **Food**: Imports food data from USDA and analyzes it.
7. **Hypothesis Test**: Uses postgresql for the database creation, and z-value to perform hypothesis test.
8. **Etsy**: Uses web scraping to extract product information into a database.


Each project is contained within its own .py or .ipynb file, along with outputs and explanations of the code.

## **Note**
This repository reflects my learning journey and includes practical applications of Data Science techniques. It will continue to be updated with new projects and improvements over time.
